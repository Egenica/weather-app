# ToDo

- Tests need updating / adding to some sections
- Currently the 'Now at a glance' uses the first row of data so its not time accurate (unless it's the morning - this was added as a nice to have and needs to be time accurate)
- Uses two api calls but might needs to change to one as it's potentially overyly complicated as merges the two to display the time
- More backgrounds need adding for the counties currently it displays various pictures of yorkshire / lancs based on the quick view weather
- Some wind direction icons might not be showing
