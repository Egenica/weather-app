- Location search.

- Uses NextJs / Typescript / Tailwind.
- Backend server API for data.
- Background changes depending on time of day and weather conditions.
- Location is saved in local storage for.

# ToDo

- Tests need updating/adding to some sections.
- Currently, the 'Now at a glance' feature uses the first row of data, so it's not time-accurate unless it's in the morning. This was added as a "nice to have" feature but needs to be made time-accurate.
- The 'Now at a glance' feature should also change when the day is changed.
- It uses two API calls but might need to change to one, as it's potentially overly complicated by merging the two to display the time.
- More backgrounds need to be added for the counties. Currently, it displays various pictures of Yorkshire/Lancashire based on the quick view weather.
- Some wind direction icons might not be showing.
- Currently, the background can get stuck between viewing sessions; refreshing again fixes it, but this needs to be looked into (there's some kind of caching going onâ€”it might be a local storage issue and needs investigation).
- There might be weather conditions where there are no icons, but I haven't seen that yet.
- Code test coverage needs to be added.
